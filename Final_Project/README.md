Using SimPy, write a process simulation that includes waiting time (discrete event simulation).  You may use any topic of interest to you.  Write the simulation and all of the following in Jupyter.

Each element is worth 5 points and will be graded using the rubric shown here.

1.  State the problem and its significance.

2.  Provide a flow-chart model. 

3.  Simulate the process for the appropriate number of iterations (justify)

4.  Justify the validity of the model and discuss how you verified it.

5.  State  your conclusions/ findings from the model. 

6.  Generate appropriate graphs (more than one) to illustrate the results and provide a PowerPoint presentation to share with your colleagues.  Post this to the discussion. 

Be sure that your code works!
