## Hockey Stick Factory 
### Simulation

* The goal of this project was building a Manufacturing Simulation using the Python Package `simpy`.
* In simplistic terms, the construction of a hockey stick can be subsetted into the shaft of the stick and the blade piece  elements.
* In this simulation, both the shaft and the blade are constructed seperately, however, from the same type of Graphite material. 
* Then both elements are passed to be painted by the same Paint material.
* From there, both elements are passed to the assembly area where both pieces will be fitted together and a coated of Polyurethane will be applied. 
* That is only a small look at this simulation from the surface.

## Flow Chart 
### Explanation

* In the simulation there are two main `simpy` containers comprised of *"Graphite"* and *"Polyurethane"*. 
  - Containing `N` amount of both graphite and polyurenthane  materials that will be utilized for production.
  
* A hockey stick will be fashioned into two parts from material in the graphite container.

* Part A being the shaft of the stick, which will then be stored in the Shaft Storage A awaiting painting.

* The same process will occur with the blade end of the stick, however unlike the stick which is build from one piece of graphite, two blade can be with one piece of graphite.

* The painting process will collect both the shafts and blades from their respective storages then be moved to the Shaft and Blade Storage Containers B.

## Flow Chart Explanation
### Continued 


* The assembly will then collect a shaft and a blade element, taking Polyurenthane from the Container and assembling the hockey stick.

* Then the completed hockey stick will be stored in the Dispatch container.
  - After an `N` amount of hockey sticks are stored after constuction, an alert will be sent for the Pro Shop to pick the sticks up.
  
* In addition, when either the Graphite and/or Polyurethane Containers reach below a certain critical level of material, an alert to call a Supplier go out.  
  - After `T` amount of days, the Supplier will arrive at the factory and the critical levels of the material will be accounted for.

  
## Constuctor Class

```python

class Hockey_Stick_Factory:
    def __init__(self, env):
        self.graphite = simpy.Container(env, capacity=graphite_capacity, init=initial_graphite)
        self.graphite_control = env.process(self.graphite_stock_control(env))
        self.poly = simpy.Container(env, capacity=poly_capacity, init=initial_poly)
        self.poly_control = env.process(self.polyurethane_stock_control(env))
        self.shaft_pre_paint = simpy.Container(env, capacity=shaft_pre_paint_capacity, init=0)
        self.blade_pre_paint = simpy.Container(env, capacity=blade_pre_paint_capacity, init=0)
        self.shaft_post_paint = simpy.Container(env, capacity=shaft_post_paint_capacity, init=0)
        self.blade_post_paint = simpy.Container(env, capacity=blade_post_paint_capacity, init=0)
        self.dispatch = simpy.Container(env, capacity=dispatch_capacity, init=0)
        self.dispatch_control = env.process(self.dispatch_sticks_control(env))

```

## Shaft Builder 
### Algorithm Construction

```python

def shaft_builder(env, hockey_stick_factory):
    while True:
        yield hockey_stick_factory.graphite.get(1)
        shaft_time = random.gauss(mean_shaft, std_shaft)
        yield env.timeout(shaft_time)
        yield hockey_stick_factory.shaft_pre_paint.put(1)

```
Note: This loop will be used in all the "builder" function through this program creating:
       2 shaft builders, 1 blade builder, 1 painter and 4 assemblers.


## Simpy
### Enviroment Construction

```python

env = simpy.Environment()
hockey_stick_factory = Hockey_Stick_Factory(env)

shaft_gen = env.process(shaft_builder_gen(env, hockey_stick_factory))
blade_gen = env.process(blade_builder_gen(env, hockey_stick_factory))
painter_gen = env.process(painter_job_gen(env, hockey_stick_factory))
assembler_gen = env.process(assembler_job_gen(env, hockey_stick_factory))

env.run(until=total_time)

```
## Month Simulation

## Year Simulation

```python

for i in range(12):
    env = simpy.Environment()
    hockey_stick_factory = Hockey_Stick_Factory(env)
    shaft_gen = env.process(shaft_builder_gen(env, hockey_stick_factory))
    blade_gen = env.process(blade_builder_gen(env, hockey_stick_factory))
    painter_gen = env.process(painter_job_gen(env, hockey_stick_factory))
    assembler_gen = env.process(assembler_job_gen(env, hockey_stick_factory))

    env.run(until=total_time)

```

## Conclusion

There are many advantages for running a Manufacturing Simulation, from estimating productivity to projecting growth. Today, given the Supply Chain issues that the world is facing, it is more crucial than ever to keep track of inventory. This allows for companies or manufacturers not only to check if their inventory is low but if it is over stocked as well. Inventory is money wasting away, however, running out of stock is an entirely seperate issue.

`Simpy` is a great package for create Discrete Event Simulation and would highly recommend it to anyone in the field. 

## Looking Forward 

* I created this simulation to work well within a Python Environment and print out the variable counts very well. However, this lead to some difficult retrieving the hockey stick total that were store in the Dispatch `simpy` container. 

* I would like to rework this simulation to be able to store this data in additional `pandas` DataFrame for easy analysis.

* In addition, I would like to make this more User Friendly, creating a Flask Application with interchangeable variable conditions.
