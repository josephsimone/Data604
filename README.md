Course Description:
This course teaches students the basics of simulation, systems modeling, and related software applications. The objective is to introduce students to the theory, statistical aspects, and implementation of computational methods for stochastic simulation and event-driven systems modeling. Students will be exposed to topics such as random sampling, Monte Carlo integration, variance reduction, Markov methods, queuing theory, discrete-event systems simulation, input/output data analysis, and simulation- based optimization. Students will develop a contextual understanding of simulation and modeling techniques by implementing the covered methods.
Learning Objectives:
1. Create Simulation Models
2. Evaluate Simulation Models
Program Learning Outcomes/Competencies addressed by the course:
1. Business Understanding. Apply frameworks and processes to build data-analytic solutions from an understanding of business goals.
2. Data Programming. Use industry standard statistical tools and simulation packages.
3. Foundational Math and Statistics. Emphasis on probability, statistics, and computational methods.
4. Data Understanding. Collect, describe, model, explore and verify data.
5. Prescriptive Modeling. Selecting prescriptive modeling techniques, generating test designs, building and assessing models.
6. Model Implementation and Deployment. Students will learn to implement simulation models for the various prescriptive modeling techniques covered in the course.
7. Presentation. Students will deliver presentations of their project results.
How is this course relevant for IS and data analytics professionals?
Simulation and modeling techniques are essential skills in todayâ€™s data-driven business environment where there is inherent uncertainty embedded in real-world decision-making processes. The material covered in this course lies at the heart of prescriptive data analytics, which suggests decision options on how to take advantage of a future opportunity or mitigate a future risk, while showing the implication of each decision option.
